--Task 1
--Write a SQL query calculating sales volume (sum(sales_amount)) aggregated by country and customer age groups. 
=--Age groups should be for every 10 years, i.e. 0-9, 10-19, ...

--postgres sql
select country,
case when age>=0 and age<10 then '0-9'
when age>=10 and age<20 then '10-19'
when age>=20 and age<30 then '20-29'
when age>=30 and age<40 then '30-39'
when age>=40 and age<50 then '40-49'
when age>=50 and age<60 then '50-59'
when age>=60 and age<70 then '60-69'
when age>=70 and age<80 then '70-79'

end as age,

left join (select customer_id, country, extract(year from age(c.dob,now())) as age  from test.d_customer c) c
on a.customer_id=c.customer_id
group by 1,2;

--Task 2
--Calculate the total amount of commision paid sum(commission_percent * sales_amount) assuming that commission is also paid for every agent up in the hierarchy tree. For example, if in the sales record agent_id=10 the IDs of agents receiving commission are: 10,5,2,1,0 with --rates corresponding to sales dates.

select a.agent_id,
sum(commission_percent * sales_amount) as commision

from test.f_sales a
left join test.d_agent b
on a.agent_id=b.agent_id
and sales_date>=start_date and sales_date<end_date
group by 1;

--Task 3
--Propose a design of a new table which would simplify calculations such as in Task 2. Assume an arbitrary maximum number of levels.

--Table sales commision
create table test.sales_commision

select a.agent_id,
sales_date,
parent_agent_id,
commission_percent,
sales_amount,
commission_percent * sales_amount as commision
